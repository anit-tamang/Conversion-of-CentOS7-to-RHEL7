Other Tips;
•	Uninstall or install the dependencies packages by checking it by, yum check dependencies
•	Disable the running critical services.
•	After the successfully conversion to rhel enable and start the services that we have previously disable before conversion.
For the log’s files;
•	/var/log/convert2rhel/convert2rhel.log        to debug, info, warning, error and critical messages.
•	/var/log/convert2rhel/rpm_va.log               file lists all package files on the unconverted system that a user has modified. This output is generated by the rpm-va command, which is run automatically unless the –no-rpm-va option is used with the convert2rhel command.
