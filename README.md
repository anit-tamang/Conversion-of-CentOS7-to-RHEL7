CentOS to RHEL

I have an operating system of CentOS of version 7 and I want to convert this to RHEL7 by converting this.

Install Convert2RHEL:
Download the Red Hat GPG key:
# curl -o /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release https://www.redhat.com/security/data/fd431d51.txt
                
Install the Convert2RHEL repository file:
#curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/convert2rhel.repo https://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/convert2rhel/<version_number>/convert2rhel.repo
 
Replace version_number with the appropriate major version of the OS, for example 7 or 8.
Install the Convert2RHEL utility:
# yum -y install convert2rhel
 
#yum -y install subscription-manager
 
#subscription-manager register
Username:
Password:
 
#convert2rhel analyze
For dry run.

Note: There may be some issue, for eg: issues of kernel, services are running. Disable it and run the command and follow the executed information.
 
#convert2rhel
or
#convert2rhel -u username -p password
 
If no issues arise then it will convert CentOS into RHEL.
 
#reboot
#cat /etc/os-release
 
Now, we can see our OS has been changed into rhel7.

Other Tips;
•	Uninstall or install the dependencies packages by checking it by, yum check dependencies
•	Disable the running critical services.
•	After the successfully conversion to rhel enable and start the services that we have previously disable before conversion.
For the log’s files;
•	/var/log/convert2rhel/convert2rhel.log        to debug, info, warning, error and critical messages.
•	/var/log/convert2rhel/rpm_va.log               file lists all package files on the unconverted system that a user has modified. This output is generated by the rpm-va command, which is run automatically unless the –no-rpm-va option is used with the convert2rhel command.
